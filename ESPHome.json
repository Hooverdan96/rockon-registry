        "description": "<p>ESPHome is the perfect solution for creating custom firmwares for your ESP8266/ESP32 boards. This Rockon contains the standalone ESPHome Command Line and Web Dashboard (HomeAssistant is a separate Rockon, whose docker image does not allow for installing add-ons like this). The WebUI is accessible through the configured port, the ESPHome command line can be used by connecting to the docker image via <code>docker exec -it esphome /bin/bash</code>.</p><p><b>Note:</b><i> this Rockon requires the <code>net=host</code> option to enable device connections for ESP firmware updates; it also requires to be run in <code>privileged</code> status according to the documentation. Typically, this Rockon would be run during firmware development or updating of devices and, when not needed, be stopped again. It's not necessary to be active for ESP devices  to be recognized by Home Assistant.</i></p><p>Based on the official docker image: <a href='https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pkgs/container/esphome' target=_blank> ghcr.io/esphome/esphome</a>, available for amd64 and arm64 architecture.</p>",
